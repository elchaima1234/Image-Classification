##Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels.

##Project Overview
In this project, we trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.
The model architecture consists of several dense layers with ReLU activation functions, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
